### Trastuzumab reverses letrozole resistance and amplifies the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to estrogen
**pmcid**: [2644349](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2644349)


**doi**: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0857


**abstract**: In this study we investigated adaptive mechanisms associated with aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance in breast cancer cells and show that sensitivity to AIs can be extended through dual inhibition of Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Human Epidermal Receptor-2 (Her-2) signaling. We utilized human ER-positive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7Ca). These cells grow as tumors in nude mice and are inhibited by AIs. Despite continued treatment, tumors eventually become insensitive to AI letrozole. The cells isolated from these Long-Term Letrozole Treated tumors (LTLT-Ca) were found to have decreased ERα levels. Our results suggest that LTLT-Ca cells survive estrogen deprivation by activation of Her-2/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. Here, we demonstrate that trastuzumab (antibody against Her-2; IC50=0.4mg/ml) was very effective in restoring the ERα levels and sensitivity of LTLT-Ca cells to endocrine therapy by down-regulation of Her-2/MAPK pathway and upregulation of ERα. In contrast, trastuzumab was ineffective in the parental hormone responsive MCF-7Ca cells (IC50=4.28mg/ml) and xenografts. By blocking Her-2, trastuzumab also up-regulates ERα, aromatase expression and hyper-sensitized MCF-7Ca cells to E2. We show that trastuzumab is beneficial in hormone refractory cells and xenografts by restoring ER, implicating Her-2 as a negative regulator of ERα. In xenograft studies the combination of trastuzumab plus letrozole is equally effective in inhibiting growth of MCF-7Ca tumors as letrozole alone. However, upon the acquisition of resistance and increased Her-2 expression the combination of letrozole plus trastuzumab provided superior benefit over letrozole or trastuzumab alone.

**Figure 1C** - LTLT-Ca xenografts were grown in female OVX nude mice as described in Materials and Methods. The mice in the control and letrozole treated group exhibited similar rate of tumor growth. The difference in the exponential parameter governing growth was -0.027 (p = 0.71) over first eight weeks and 0.001 (p value = 0.97) over 19 weeks. Four doses of trastuzumab were tested. All of the tested doses caused a marked regression of LTLT-Ca xenografts. The growth rate of tumors of mice treated with trastuzumab (5mg/kg/week) was significantly different from mice in the control (p =0.0008) and letrozole treated (p = 0.0002) mice. The difference in the exponential parameter governing growth between control and trastuzumab was 0.24 (p = 0.0008). The difference in the exponential parameter governing growth between letrozole and trastuzumab was 0.27 (p value = 0.0002).

**pmcid**: [2652856](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652856)


**doi**: 10.1097/MAO.0b013e31817f7398


**abstract**: ObjectiveTo determine the ability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce the growth of vestibular schwannoma (VS) xenografts.MethodsVS xenografts were established in the interscapular fat pad in nude mice for 4 weeks. Initially, a small cohort of animals was treated with the ErbB2 inhibitor, trastuzumab, or saline for 2 weeks. Animals also received BrdU injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-term experiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor), or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL).ResultsTumors could be distinguished with T2 weighted MRI sequences. Trastuzumab significantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells compared to control (p<0.01) as determined by BrdU uptake. Control tumors demonstrated slight growth over the 12 week treatment period. Both trastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts (p<0.05). Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase in the percent of TUNEL-positive VS cells (p<0.01).ConclusionsIn this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and erlotinib decreased growth of VS xenografts in nude mice raising the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in the management of patients with schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis type 2.

**Figure 3** - Trastuzumab and Erlotinib reduce the growth of VS xenografts. A. The change in relative tumor volume was determined by subtracting the initial tumor volume (Vi) from the final tumor volume (Vf) and dividing the difference by the initial tumor volume according to the formula: (Vf-Vi)/Vi and is plotted for the 12 week interval for each xenograft. Dashed lines in control group represent animals receiving saline while solid lines represent animals receiving erlotinib vehicle. B. The average relative growth of the xenografts for each condition is plotted.. Differences among the means for the treatment groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Kruskal-Wallis test. Error bars represent standard error. Both trastuzumab (p=0.025) and erlotinib (p=0.017) reduced the growth of the VS xenografts compared with controls.


### Specific Blockade of VEGF and HER2 Pathways Results in Greater Growth Inhibition of Breast Cancer Xenografts that Overexpress HER2*
**pmcid**: [2757147](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2757147)


**doi**: 


**abstract**: We have previously reported that breast cancer cells which overexpress HER2 produce higher levels of VEGF than cells with low levels of HER2. This study tested the hypothesis that dual targeting of the VEGF (with VEGF-Trap) and HER2 (with trastuzumab) pathways would result in greater growth inhibition of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenografts than either agent alone. In this study we found that human and murine endothelial cells expressed high levels of VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, & VEGFR3). VEGF-Trap decreased levels of secreted VEGF derived from both human and murine cells and effectively blocked VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2. VEGF-Trap as a single treatment inhibited tumor microvessel density (MVD), tumor vasculature, cell proliferation, and tumor growth of BT474 xenografts in a dose-dependent manner from 2.5 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg. VEGF-Trap decreased levels of both human VEGF and PlGF protein in vivo. Trastuzumab as a single agent effectively inhibited BT474 tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, associated with a decrease in human VEGF, tumor MVD and tumor cell proliferation. Treatment with a combination of VEGF-Trap (2.5-10 mg/kg) and trastuzumab (1 mg/kg) produced significantly greater inhibition of BT474tumor growth than either individual agent, associated with greater inhibition of tumor MVD and tumor cell proliferation. Thus, VEGF-Trap in combination with trastuzumab produces superior growth inhibition of tumor xenografts which overexpress HER2, which may result from inhibition of both tumor angiogenesis and proliferation. Similar mechanisms may contribute to the clinical anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab in combination with inhibitors of VEGF signaling pathway in women with breast cancers which overexpress HER2.

### Inhibition of mTOR is required for optimal antitumor effect of HER2 inhibitors against HER2-overexpressing cancer cells
**pmcid**: [2787848](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2787848)


**doi**: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1665


**abstract**: PurposeA significant fraction of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers exhibit resistance to the HER2 antibody trastuzumab. Hyperactivity of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway confers trastuzumab resistance, and mTOR is a major downstream effector of PI3K/AKT. Therefore, we examined whether mTOR inhibitors synergize with trastuzumab.Experimental DesignImmunocompetent mice bearing HER2-positive mammary tumors were treated with trastuzumab, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the combination. Mice were imaged for tumor cell death using an optical Annexin-V probe and with [18F]FDG-PET. The signaling and growth effects of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 on HER2+ cells treated with trastuzumab or lapatinib were evaluated.ResultsTreatment of mice with trastuzumab plus rapamycin was more effective than single-agent treatments, inducing complete regression of 26/26 tumors. The combination induced tumor cell death (Annexin-V binding) and inhibited FDG uptake. Rapamycin inhibited mTOR and tumor cell proliferation as determined by phospho-S6 and Ki67 immunohistochemistry, respectively. In culture, the combination of RAD001 plus trastuzumab inhibited cell growth more effectively than either drug alone. Trastuzumab partially decreased PI3K but not mTOR activity. Knockdown of TSC2 resulted in HER2-independent activation of mTOR and dampened the response to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Treatment with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib decreased phospho-S6 and growth in TSC2-expressing but not in TSC2-knockdown cells.ConclusionsInhibition of PI3K and mTOR are required for the growth inhibitory effect of HER2 antagonists. These findings collectively support the combined use of trastuzumab and mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer.

**pmcid**: [2788792](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2788792)


**doi**: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0931


**abstract**: PurposeMetronomic chemotherapy is a minimally toxic and frequently effective new treatment strategy that is beginning to show promising phase II clinical trial results, particularly for metastatic breast cancer when combined with various molecularly targeted antitumor agents. Here, we assessed a treatment strategy that uses trastuzumab plus daily oral metronomic cyclophosphamide on metastatic Her-2–positive human breast cancer models.Experimental DesignTreatments were initiated on orthotopic transplanted primary tumors as well as established visceral metastatic disease of two independent Her-2–positive breast cancer models, both independently derived from the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Outcome was assessed by noninvasive measurements of tumor cell–secreted human choriogonadotropin in the urine as a surrogate marker of relative tumor burden, or by whole body bioluminescent imaging, in addition to prolongation of survival.ResultsOrthotopic primary tumors responded to trastuzumab monotherapy with significant growth delays, whereas minimal antitumor effect was observed when mice with metastatic disease were treated. Nevertheless, trastuzumab showed a benefit in this latter setting when combined with metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide as assessed by prolongation of survival. This benefit was similar to trastuzumab plus maximum tolerated dose cyclophosphamide, but was associated with lesser toxicity.ConclusionsTrastuzumab combined with metronomic cyclophosphamide may be an effective long-term maintenance strategy for the treatment of Her-2–positive metastatic breast cancer.

**Fig. 3** - A, effect on tumor volume (top) and hCG levels (bottom) of the different therapies on met2 orthotopically implanted primary tumors. When tumors reached 250 mm3, mice were treated with saline (control, n = 5), or trastuzumab alone (n = 6), or low-dose metronomic CTX alone (Ld CTX, n = 6) or the combination of trastuzumab plus low-dose metronomic CTX (Ld CTX+ trastuzumab, n = 6). The curves show that, similar to H2N tumors (see Fig. 1), the met2 line gave rise to primary tumors that are highly responsive to the low-dose metronomic CTX + trastuzumab combination therapy. The urine hCG values (corresponding to pooled urine hCG for each group, normalized to urine Creatinine levels) were found to be concordant with tumor volume measurements. B, treatment of met2 metastases and assessment of mouse weights. Orthotopically implanted met2 tumors were surgically removed, and 3 wk later, various therapies were initiated. Mice were treated with MTD CTX alone (MTD, n = 6) or low-dose CTX alone (n = 6) or control saline (n = 6), or trastuzumab alone (n = 6). In addition, other mice were given trastuzumab plus metronomic CTX (n = 12), or trastuzumab plus MTD CTX (n = 12; arrows, MTD dosing). Weight loss on day 115 for MTD therapies was significantly different (P < 0.05) versus the other regimens. Trastuzumab was given twice weekly at 20 mg/kg i.p., and low-dose metronomic CTX alone was ~20 mg/kg/d. C, top, hCG curves of met2 metastases treated with the regimens indicated. Note at the start of therapy (day 24), the low hCG levels made it difficult to accurately normalize the groups. As a consequence, some groups (e.g., low-dose metronomic CTX alone, see days 25–50) subsequently turned out to have relatively low hCG levels. Nonetheless, sequential hCG measurements showed controls and the monotherapies to rapidly increase after a lag phase (particularly long for the low-dose metronomic CTX group). In contrast, mice treated with the combination therapies did not show increases in hCG readings for 3 mo after treatment was initiated. The combination of MTD CTX + trastuzumab showed a decrease in hCG levels suggesting this approach to be the most effective therapy. Low-dose metronomic CTX + trastuzumab showed unchanged hCG levels for the first 3 mo of treatment, followed by an increase thereafter.

### Augmented inhibition of angiogenesis by combination of HER2 antibody chA21 and trastuzumab in human ovarian carcinoma xenograft
**pmcid**: [2939608](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939608)


**doi**: 10.1186/1757-2215-3-20


**abstract**: BackgroundchA21 is a novel tumor-inhibitory antibody which recognized subdomain I of HER2 extracellular domain with an epitope distinct from other HER2 antibodies. Previously, we demonstrated that chA21 inhibits human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV-3 growth in vitro and in vivo study. In this study, we further investigated the anti-angiogenic efficacy combination of chA21 with trastuzumab in SKOV-3 xenograft model.MethodsNude mice were s.c. challenged with SKOV-3 cells and received treatment of chA21 alone, trastuzumab alone or both antibodies together twice a week for 21 days. Tumor volume and microvessel density (MVD) were evaluated. The effect of chA21 plus trastuzumab treament on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, endothelial cells proliferation and migration, and the status of HER2 downstream pathway AKT/phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) were evaluated in vitro.ResultsIn vivo study combination of chA21 with trastuzumab resulted in reduce tumor growth and angiogenesis than each monotherapy. In vitro study, the combination of chA21 with trastuzumab inhibits VEGF secretion, endothelial cells proliferation and migration. Furthermore, the combination treatment inhibits pAKT expression.ConclusionOur findings suggested that the combination of chA21 with trastuzumab can cause augmented inhibition of angiogenesis in SKOV-3 xenograft model. Inhibition of agniogenesis may through suppression of AKT pathway. The therapeutic benefits of combination chA21 with trastuzumab warrant further study in an attempt to make the translation into the clinic.

### Cyclin E amplification/overexpression is a mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer patients
**pmcid**: [3048107](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048107)


**doi**: 10.1073/pnas.1014835108


**abstract**: Clinical benefits from trastuzumab and other anti-HER2 therapies in patients with HER2 amplified breast cancer remain limited by primary or acquired resistance. To identify potential mechanisms of resistance, we established trastuzumab-resistant HER2 amplified breast cancer cells by chronic exposure to trastuzumab treatment. Genomewide copy-number variation analyses of the resistant cells compared with parental cells revealed a focal amplification of genomic DNA containing the cyclin E gene. In a cohort of 34 HER2+ patients treated with trastuzumab-based therapy, we found that cyclin E amplification/overexpression was associated with a worse clinical benefit (33.3% compared with 87.5%, P < 0.02) and a lower progression-free survival (6 mo vs. 14 mo, P < 0.002) compared with nonoverexpressing cyclin E tumors. To dissect the potential role of cyclin E in trastuzumab resistance, we studied the effects of cyclin E overexpression and cyclin E suppression. Cyclin E overexpression resulted in resistance to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of cyclin E activity in cyclin E-amplified trastuzumab resistant clones, either by knockdown of cyclin E expression or treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitors, led to a dramatic decrease in proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. In vivo, CDK2 inhibition significantly reduced tumor growth of trastuzumab-resistant xenografts. Our findings point to a causative role for cyclin E overexpression and the consequent increase in CDK2 activity in trastuzumab resistance and suggest that treatment with CDK2 inhibitors may be a valid strategy in patients with breast tumors with HER2 and cyclin E coamplification/overexpression.

### Controlled Extracellular Matrix Degradation in Breast Cancer Tumors Improves Therapy by TrastuzumabStem Cell Gene Therapy of Breast Cancer
**pmcid**: [3048180](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048180)


**doi**: 10.1038/mt.2010.256


**abstract**: Extracellular matrix (ECM) in solid tumors affects the effectiveness of therapeutics through blocking of intratumoral diffusion and/or physical masking of target receptors on malignant cells. In immunohistochemical studies of tumor sections from breast cancer patients and xenografts, we observed colocalization of ECM proteins and Her2/neu, a tumor-associated antigen that is the target for the widely used monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). We tested whether intratumoral expression of the peptide hormone relaxin (Rlx) would result in ECM degradation and the improvement of trastuzumab therapy. As viral gene delivery into epithelial tumors with extensive tumor ECM is inefficient, we used a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based approach to deliver the Rlx gene to the tumor. In mouse models with syngeneic breast cancer tumors, HSC-mediated intratumoral Rlx expression resulted in a decrease of ECM proteins and enabled control of tumor growth. Moreover, in a model with Her2/neu-positive BT474-M1 tumors and more treatment-refractory tumors derived from HCC1954 cells, we observed a significant delay of tumor growth when trastuzumab therapy was combined with Rlx expression. Our results have implications for antibody therapy of cancer as well as for other anticancer treatment approaches that are based on T-cells or encapsulated chemotherapy drugs.

**doi**: 10.1371/journal.pone.0017541


**abstract**: BackgroundPlant biotechnology provides a valuable contribution to global health, in part because it can decrease the cost of pharmaceutical products. Breast cancer can now be successfully treated by a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), trastuzumab (Herceptin). A course of treatment, however, is expensive and requires repeated administrations of the mAb. Here we used an Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system to produce trastuzumab in plant cells.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe describe the cloning and expression of gene constructs in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using intron-optimized Tobacco mosaic virus- and Potato virus X-based vectors encoding, respectively, the heavy and light chains of trastuzumab. Full-size antibodies extracted and purified from plant tissues were tested for functionality and specificity by (i) binding to HER2/neu on the surface of a human mammary gland adenocarcinoma cell line, SK-BR-3, in fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay and (ii) testing the in vitro and in vivo inhibition of HER-2-expressing cancer cell proliferation. We show that plant-made trastuzumab (PMT) bound to the Her2/neu oncoprotein of SK-BR-3 cells and efficiently inhibited SK-BR-3 cell proliferation. Furthermore, mouse intraperitoneal PMT administration retarded the growth of xenografted tumors derived from human ovarian cancer SKOV3 Her2+ cells.Conclusions/SignificanceWe conclude that PMT is active in suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth.

**Figure 6** - The treatment groups received their first doses (20 mg/kg) of PMT (n=7) and trastuzumab (n=10) in saline solution i.p. 6 days after SKOV3 implantation, and then for 16 days, they received 8 consecutive injections (10 mg/kg). The control group (n=34) received saline solution. Tumor volumes were recorded in intervals 10–14, 18–22 and 23–27 days after SKOV3 implantation using a caliper. Data are the mean ± standard deviations from two independent experiments. Asterisk shows P<0.05 by the unpaired two tailed Student's t-test for statistical significance of difference between the PMT and trastuzumab treatment and control.

**pmcid**: [3060302](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060302)


**doi**: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1905


**abstract**: PurposeWe have shown that incomplete blockade of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor (HER) pathway is a mechanism of resistance to treatment with trastuzumab (T) in HER2-overexpressing tumor xenografts. We now investigate whether the addition of lapatinib (L), a dual HER1/2 kinase inhibitor, to T results in more potent inhibition of the pathway and therefore inhibition of tumor growth, and whether reduced dose and intermittent treatment with the combination is equally effective.Experimental DesignNude mice bearing HER2-overexpressing MCF7/HER2-18 or BT474 xenograft tumors were treated with L, T, alone or in various combinations with other HER inhibitors. L+T for short duration (14, 42 days), intermittent administration (14 days on/off), and reduced dosing (1/2 dose) was also investigated. Inhibition of tumor growth, downstream signaling, proliferation, and induction of apoptosis were assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided.ResultsL+T was the most effective regimen in both MCF7/HER2-18 and BT474 xenografts with complete tumor regression (CR) observed in all mice. Intermittent and reduced dose treatment (½ dose) resulted in high rates of CR and low rates of tumor recurrence that were comparable to full dose continuous treatment. L+T resulted in significantly reduced downstream signaling and proliferation, and increased apoptosis.ConclusionsL+T is a potent and effective combination even when given in reduced dose or intermittent schedule potentially resulting in lower toxicity and reduced cost if translated to patients. These findings warrant timely clinical testing.

### Up-regulation of miR-21 Mediates Resistance to Trastuzumab Therapy for Breast Cancer*miR-21 Mediates Trastuzumab Resistance
**pmcid**: [3099726](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099726)


**doi**: 10.1074/jbc.M110.216887


**abstract**: Trastuzumab resistance emerges to be a major issue in anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy for breast cancers. Here, we demonstrated that miR-21 expression was up-regulated and its function was elevated in HER2+ BT474, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells that are induced to acquire trastuzumab resistance by long-term exposure to the antibody, whereas protein expression of the PTEN gene, a miR-21 target, was reduced. Blocking the action of miR-21 with antisense oligonucleotides re-sensitized the resistant cells to the therapeutic activities of trastuzumab by inducing growth arrest, proliferation inhibition, and G1-S cell cycle checking in the presence of the antibody. Ectopic expression of miR-21 in HER2+ breast cancer cells confers resistance to trastuzumab. Rescuing PTEN expression with a p3XFLAG-PTEN-mut construct with deleted miR-21 targeting sequence at its 3′ UTR restored the growth inhibition of trastuzumab in the resistant cells by inducing PTEN activation and AKT inhibition. In vivo, administering miR-21 antisense oligonucleotides restored trastuzumab sensitivity in the resistant breast cancer xenografts by inducing PTEN expression, whereas injection of miR-21 mimics conferred trastuzumab resistant in the sensitive breast tumors via PTEN silence. Up-regulatin of miR-21 in tumor biopsies obtained from patients receiving pre-operative trastuzumab therapy was associated with poor trastuzumab response. Therefore, miR-21 overexpression contributes to trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancers and antagonizing miR-21 demonstrates therapeutic potential by sensitizing the malignancy to anti-HER2 treatment.

### Overcoming Trastuzumab Resistance in Breast Cancer by Targeting Dysregulated Glucose Metabolism
**pmcid**: [3129363](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3129363)


**doi**: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0127


**abstract**: Trastuzumab shows remarkable efficacy in treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancers when used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients, necessitating alternate treatment strategies. Increased aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer and inhibition of glycolysis may offer a promising strategy to preferentially kill cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of trastuzumab in combination with glycolysis inhibitors in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. We found that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via downregulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) in ErbB2-positive cancer cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, increased glycolysis via HSF1 and LDH-A contributes to trastuzumab resistance. Importantly, we found that combining trastuzumab with glycolysis inhibition synergistically inhibited trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancers in vitro and in vivo, due to more efficient inhibition of glycolysis. Taken together, our findings show how glycolysis inhibition can dramatically enhance the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab in ErbB2-positive breast cancers, potentially useful as a strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.

### Glycoengineered Pichia produced anti-HER2 is comparable to trastuzumab in preclinical study
**pmcid**: [3149709](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149709)


**doi**: 10.4161/mabs.3.3.15532


**abstract**: Mammalian cell culture systems are used predominantly for the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) products. A number of alternative platforms, such as Pichia engineered with a humanized N-linked glycosylation pathway, have recently been developed for the production of mAbs. The glycosylation profiles of mAbs produced in glycoengineered Pichia are similar to those of mAbs produced in mammalian systems. This report presents for the first time the comprehensive characterization of an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mAb produced in glycoengineered Pichia, and a study comparing the anti-HER2 from Pichia, which had an amino acid sequence identical to trastuzumab, with trastuzumab. The comparative study covered a full spectrum of preclinical evaluation, including bioanalytical characterization, in vitro biological functions, in vivo anti-tumor efficacy and pharmacokinetics in both mice and non-human primates. Cell signaling and proliferation assays showed that anti-HER2 from Pichia had antagonist activities comparable to trastuzumab. However, Pichia-produced material showed a 5-fold increase in binding affinity to FcγIIIA and significantly enhanced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, presumably due to the lack of fucose on N-glycans. In a breast cancer xenograft mouse model, anti-HER2 was comparable to trastuzumab in tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, comparable pharmacokinetic profiles were observed for anti-HER2 and trastuzumab in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys. We conclude that glycoengineered Pichia provides an alternative production platform for therapeutic mAbs and may be of particular interest for production of antibodies for which ADCC is part of the clinical mechanism of action.

### The Potential Utility of Curcumin in the Treatment of HER-2-Overexpressed Breast Cancer: An In Vitro and In Vivo Comparison Study with Herceptin
**pmcid**: [3162976](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3162976)


**doi**: 10.1155/2012/486568


**abstract**: HER-2 is an important oncoprotein overexpressed in about 15–25% of breast cancers. We hypothesized that the ability of curcumin to downregulate HER-2 oncoprotein and inhibit the signal transduction pathway of PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB activation may be important in the treatment of HER-2-overexpressed breast cancer. To examine the effect of curcumin on breast cancer cells, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A, BT-474, and SK-BR-3-hr (a herceptin resistant strain from SK-BR-3) cells were used for in vitro analysis. The in vivo effect of curcumin on HER-2-overexpressed breast cancer was investigated with the HER-2-overexpressed BT-474 xenograft model. Cell growth, cell cycle change, the antimobility effect, signal transduction, and xenograft volume analysis between groups treated with herceptin and/or curcumin were tested. Curcumin decreased the cell growth of various breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A, BT-474, and SK-BR-3-hr). In Western blot analysis, the phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK, and expression of NF-κB were reduced in BT-474 cells, but not in SK-BR-3-hr cells, after treatment with herceptin. When treated with curcumin, the HER-2 oncoprotein, phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK and expression of NF-κB were decreased in both BT-474 and SK-BR-3-hr cells. In the BT-474 xenograft model, though not as much as herceptin, curcumin did effectively decrease the tumor size. The combination of curcumin with herceptin was not better than herceptin alone; however, the combination of taxol and curcumin had an antitumor effect comparable with taxol and herceptin. The results suggested that curcumin has potential as a treatment for HER-2-overexpressed breast cancer.

### The vitamin E analog, alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic acid enhances the anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab against HER2/neu-expressing breast cancer
**pmcid**: [3217981](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217981)


**doi**: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-471


**abstract**: BackgroundHER2/neu is an oncogene that facilitates neoplastic transformation due to its ability to transduce growth signals in a ligand-independent manner, is over-expressed in 20-30% of human breast cancers correlating with aggressive disease and has been successfully targeted with trastuzumab (Herceptin®). Because trastuzumab alone achieves only a 15-30% response rate, it is now commonly combined with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. While the combination of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy has greatly improved response rates and increased survival, these conventional chemotherapy drugs are frequently associated with gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity, bone marrow and immune suppression. These drawbacks necessitate the development of new, less toxic drugs that can be combined with trastuzumab. Recently, we reported that orally administered alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic acid (α-TEA), a novel ether derivative of alpha-tocopherol, dramatically suppressed primary tumor growth and reduced the incidence of lung metastases both in a transplanted and a spontaneous mouse model of breast cancer without discernable toxicity.MethodsIn this study we examined the effect of α-TEA plus HER2/neu-specific antibody treatment on HER2/neu-expressing breast cancer cells in vitro and in a HER2/neu positive human xenograft tumor model in vivo.ResultsWe show in vitro that α-TEA plus anti-HER2/neu antibody has an increased cytotoxic effect against murine mammary tumor cells and human breast cancer cells and that the anti-tumor effect of α-TEA is independent of HER2/neu status. More importantly, in a human breast cancer xenograft model, the combination of α-TEA plus trastuzumab resulted in faster tumor regression and more tumor-free animals than trastuzumab alone.ConclusionDue to the cancer cell selectivity of α-TEA, and because α-TEA kills both HER2/neu positive and HER2/neu negative breast cancer cells, it has the potential to be effective and less toxic than existing chemotherapeutic drugs when used in combination with HER2/neu antibody.

**pmcid**: [3250964](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250964)


**doi**: 10.1186/2191-219X-1-18


**abstract**: BackgroundThe aim of the present study was to explore the biodistribution, normal tissue toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy of the internalizing low-dose rate alpha-particle-emitting radioimmunoconjugate 227Th-trastuzumab in mice with HER2-expressing breast cancer xenografts.MethodsBiodistribution of 227Th-trastuzumab and 227Th-rituximab in nude mice bearing SKBR-3 xenografts were determined at different time points after injection. Tumor growth was measured after administration of 227Th-trastuzumab, 227Th-rituximab, cold trastuzumab, and saline. The toxicity of 227Th-trastuzumab was evaluated by measurements of body weight, blood cell, and clinical chemistry parameters, as well as histological examination of tissue specimens.ResultsThe tumor uptake reached peak levels of 34% ID/g (4.6 kBq/g) 3 days after injection of 400 kBq/kg of 227Th-trastuzumab. The absorbed radiation dose to tumor was 2.9 Gy, while it was 2.4 Gy to femur due to uptake of the daughter nuclide 223Ra in bone; the latter already explored in clinical phases I and II trials without serious toxicity. A significant dose-dependent antitumor effect was observed for dosages of 200, 400, and 600 kBq/kg of 227Th-trastuzumab but no effect of 400 and 600 kBq/kg 227Th-rituximab (non-tumor binding). No serious delayed bone marrow or normal organ toxicity was observed, but there was a statistical significant reduction in blood cell parameters for the highest-dose group of 227Th-trastuzumab treatment.ConclusionInternalizing 227Th-trastuzumab therapy was well tolerated and resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of breast cancer xenograft growth. These results warrant further preclinical studies aiming at a clinical trial in breast cancer patients with metastases to bone.

### In Pancreatic Carcinoma, Dual EGFR/HER2 Targeting with Cetuximab/Trastuzumab Is More Effective than Treatment with Trastuzumab/Erlotinib or Lapatinib Alone: Implication of Receptors' Down-regulation and Dimers' Disruption1
**pmcid**: [3306257](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306257)


**doi**: 


**abstract**: We previously demonstrated the synergistic therapeutic effect of the cetuximab (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] monoclonal antibody, mAb)-trastuzumab (anti-HER2 mAb) combination (2mAbs therapy) in HER2low human pancreatic carcinoma xenografts. Here, we compared the 2mAbs therapy, the erlotinib (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI])-trastuzumab combination and lapatinib alone (dual HER2/EGFR TKI) and explored their possible mechanisms of action. The effects on tumor growth and animal survival of the three therapies were assessed in nude mice xenografted with the human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines Capan-1 and BxPC-3. After therapy, EGFR and HER2 expression and AKT phosphorylation in tumor cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis. EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization was quantified in BxPC-3 cells by time-resolved FRET. In K-ras-mutated Capan-1 xenografts, the 2mAbs therapy gave significantly higher inhibition of tumor growth than the erlotinib/trastuzumab combination, whereas in BxPC-3 (wild-type K-ras) xenografts, the erlotinib/trastuzumab combination showed similar growth inhibition but fewer tumor-free mice. Lapatinib showed no antitumor effect in both types of xenografts. The efficacy of the 2mAbs therapy was partly Fc-independent because F(ab′)2 fragments of the two mAbs significantly inhibited BxPC-3 growth, although with a time-limited therapeutic effect. The 2mAbs therapy was associated with a reduction of EGFR and HER2 expression and AKT phosphorylation. BxPC-3 cells preincubated with the two mAbs showed 50% less EGFR/HER2 heterodimers than controls. In pancreatic carcinoma xenografts, the 2mAbs therapy is more effective than treatments involving dual EGFR/HER2 TKIs. The mechanism of action may involve decreased AKT phosphorylation and/or disruption of EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization.

### Different mechanisms for resistance to trastuzumab versus lapatinib in HER2- positive breast cancers -- role of estrogen receptor and HER2 reactivation
**pmcid**: [3326563](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326563)


**doi**: 10.1186/bcr3067


**abstract**: IntroductionThe human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies trastuzumab (T) and lapatinib (L) show high efficacy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, but resistance is prevalent. Here we investigate resistance mechanisms to each drug alone, or to their combination using a large panel of HER2-positive cell lines made resistant to these drugs.MethodsResponse to L + T treatment was characterized in a panel of 13 HER2-positive cell lines to identify lines that were de novo resistant. Acquired resistant lines were then established by long-term exposure to increasing drug concentrations. Levels and activity of HER2 and estrogen receptor (ER) pathways were determined by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting assays. Cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis in parental cells and resistant derivatives were assessed in response to inhibition of HER or ER pathways, either pharmacologically (L, T, L + T, or fulvestrant) or by using siRNAs. Efficacy of combined endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies was studied in vivo using UACC-812 xenografts.ResultsER or its downstream products increased in four out of the five ER+/HER2+ lines, and was evident in one of the two intrinsically resistant lines. In UACC-812 and BT474 parental and resistant derivatives, HER2 inhibition by T reactivated HER network activity to promote resistance. T-resistant lines remained sensitive to HER2 inhibition by either L or HER2 siRNA. With more complete HER2 blockade, resistance to L-containing regimens required the activation of a redundant survival pathway, ER, which was up-regulated and promoted survival via various Bcl2 family members. These L- and L + T-resistant lines were responsive to fulvestrant and to ER siRNA. However, after prolonged treatment with L, but not L + T, BT474 cells switched from depending on ER as a survival pathway, to relying again on the HER network (increased HER2, HER3, and receptor ligands) to overcome L's effects. The combination of endocrine and L + T HER2-targeted therapies achieved complete tumor regression and prevented development of resistance in UACC-812 xenografts.ConclusionsCombined L + T treatment provides a more complete and stable inhibition of the HER network. With sustained HER2 inhibition, ER functions as a key escape/survival pathway in ER-positive/HER2-positive cells. Complete blockade of the HER network, together with ER inhibition, may provide optimal therapy in selected patients.

### Polymalic Acid–Based Nanobiopolymer Provides Efficient Systemic Breast Cancer Treatment by Inhibiting both HER2/neu Receptor Synthesis and Activity
**pmcid**: [3428373](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3428373)


**doi**: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3093


**abstract**: Biodegradable nanopolymers are believed to offer great potential in cancer therapy. Here, we report the characterization of a novel, targeted, nanobiopolymeric conjugate based on biodegradable, nontoxic, and nonimmunogenic PMLA [poly(β-l-malic acid)]. The PMLA nanoplatform was synthesized for repetitive systemic treatments of HER2/neu-positive human breast tumors in a xenogeneic mouse model. Various moieties were covalently attached to PMLA, including a combination of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (AON) directed against HER2/neu mRNA, to block new HER2/neu receptor synthesis; anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), to target breast cancer cells and inhibit receptor activity simultaneously; and transferrin receptor antibody, to target the tumor vasculature and mediate delivery of the nanobiopolymer through the host endothelial system. The results of the study showed that the lead drug tested significantly inhibited the growth of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by enhanced apoptosis and inhibition of HER2/neu receptor signaling with suppression of Akt phosphorylation. In vivo imaging analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated selective accumulation of the nanodrug in tumor cells via an active delivery mechanism. Systemic treatment of human breast tumor-bearing nude mice resulted in more than 90% inhibition of tumor growth and tumor regression, as compared with partial (50%) tumor growth inhibition in mice treated with trastuzumab or AON, either free or attached to PMLA. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for use of the PMLA nanoplatform for combination cancer therapy.

P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfRM) treatment produced the highest inhibition of tumor growth resulting in 80% to 95% tumor regression during the follow-up period compared with other treatment groups (P < 0. 02 vs. Herceptin and other drugs; P < 0. 001 vs. PBS). Error bars denote SEM. C, Expression of select markers after treatment of HER2/neu-positive tumors in vivo. Western blot analysis revealed the decrease in HER2/neu and p-Akt (but not total Akt) expression in Herceptin-, P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin-, or P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfRH/M)-treated mice compared with PBS-treated ones. P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfRM) further inhibited HER2/neu expression, with near disappearance of p-Akt band. PARP cleavage as a measure of apoptosis was also the most pronounced in P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfRM)-treated mice compared with other groups. GAPDH was an internal control to normalize gel loading.


### Regulation of ERBB2 Receptor by t-DARPP Mediates Trastuzumab Resistance in Human Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
**pmcid**: [3432752](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432752)


**doi**: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1119


**abstract**: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor outcome. Although targeting ERBB2 with trastuzumab is evaluated in clinical trials, the molecular mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance remain uncharacterized in EAC. The dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32), also known as PPP1R1B, is located together with ERBB2 at the 17q12-q21 amplicon. We evaluated the expression of a transcript variant of DARPP-32 (t-DARPP) and ERBB2 in 141 primary tumors and investigated the role of t-DARPP in trastuzumab resistance using OE19 and OE33 EAC cell models. Overexpression of t-DARPP mRNA was detected in two-thirds of tumors with a correlation between ERBB2 and t-DARPP overexpression levels (r=0.58, p=0.003). Cell viability and clonogenic survival assays showed that t-DARPP increased survival by 40% in response to trastuzumab (p<0.01). The Annexin-V staining and Western blot analysis indicated that t-DARPP effectively abrogated trastuzumab-induced apoptosis, inhibited cleavage of caspase-3 and blocked trastuzumab-induced dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and AKT proteins. The knockdown of endogenous t-DARPP reversed these effects and sensitized cells to trastuzumab (p<0.01). The cycloheximide-based protein degradation analysis indicated that t-DARPP extended the half-life of ERBB2 explaining the increase in the basal levels of ERBB2, p-ERBB2(Y1248), and p-AKT(S473). Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis demonstrated that t-DARPP associated with ERBB2 in a protein complex, and interfered with trastuzumab binding to the ERBB2 receptor. Using EAC-xenografted mouse model, t-DARPP enhanced tumor growth and rendered tumors unresponsive to trastuzumab. This study establishes t-DARPP as a mediator of trastuzumab resistance and underscores its potential importance in clinical trials of EAC.

### Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy in patient-derived esophageal squamous cell carcinoma xenograft (PDECX) mouse models
**pmcid**: [3485623](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485623)


**doi**: 10.1186/1479-5876-10-180


**abstract**: BackgroundTrastuzumab is currently approved for the clinical treatment of breast and gastric cancer patients with HER-2 positive tumors, but not yet for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma patients, whose tumors typically show 5 ~ 35% HER-2 gene amplification and 0 ~ 56% HER-2 protein expression. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Trastuzumab in patient-derived esophageal squamous cell carcinoma xenograft (PDECX) mouse models.MethodsPDECX models were established by implanting patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues into immunodeficient (SCID/nude) mice. HER-2 gene copy number (GCN) and protein expression were determined in xenograft tissues and corresponding patient EC samples by FISH and IHC analysis. Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated within these PDECX models (n = 8 animals/group). Furthermore, hotspot mutations of EGFR, K-ras, B-raf and PIK3CA genes were screened for in the PDECX models and their corresponding patient’s ESCC tissues. Similarity between the PDECX models and their corresponding patient’s ESCC tissue was confirmed by histology, morphology, HER-2 GCN and mutation.ResultsNone of the PDECX models (or their corresponding patient’s ESCC tissues) harbored HER-2 gene amplification. IHC staining showed HER-2 positivity (IHC 2+) in 2 PDECX models and negativity in 3 PDECX models. Significant tumor regression was observed in the Trastuzumab-treated EC044 HER-2 positive model (IHC 2+). A second HER-2 positive (IHC 2+) model, EC039, harbored a known PIK3CA mutation and showed strong activation of the AKT signaling pathway and was insensitive to Trastuzumab treatment, but could be resensitised using a combination of Trastuzumab and AKT inhibitor AZD5363. In summary, we established 5 PDECX mouse models and demonstrated tumor regression in response to Trastuzumab treatment in a HER-2 IHC 2+ model, but resistance in a HER-2 IHC 2+/PIK3CA mutated model.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates Trastuzumab-induced tumor regressions in HER-2 positive tumors, and highlights PIK3CA mutation as a potential resistance mechanism to Trastuzumab treatment in pre-clinical patient-derived EC xenograft models.

### Combined targeting of HER2 and VEGFR2 for effective treatment of HER2-amplified breast cancer brain metastasesTreatment of breast cancer brain metastases
**pmcid**: [3494882](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494882)


**doi**: 10.1073/pnas.1216078109


**abstract**: Brain metastases are a serious obstacle in the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)–amplified breast cancer. Although extracranial disease is controlled with HER2 inhibitors in the majority of patients, brain metastases often develop. Because these brain metastases do not respond to therapy, they are frequently the reason for treatment failure. We developed a mouse model of HER2-amplified breast cancer brain metastasis using an orthotopic xenograft of BT474 cells. As seen in patients, the HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab and lapatinib controlled tumor progression in the breast but failed to contain tumor growth in the brain. We observed that the combination of a HER2 inhibitor with an anti–VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) antibody significantly slows tumor growth in the brain, resulting in a striking survival benefit. This benefit appears largely due to an enhanced antiangiogenic effect: Combination therapy reduced both the total and functional microvascular density in the brain xenografts. In addition, the combination therapy led to a marked increase in necrosis of the brain lesions. Moreover, we observed even better antitumor activity after combining both trastuzumab and lapatinib with the anti-VEGFR2 antibody. This triple-drug combination prolonged the median overall survival fivefold compared with the control-treated group and twofold compared with either two-drug regimen. These findings support the clinical development of this three-drug regimen for the treatment of HER2-amplified breast cancer brain metastases.

### Ultrasound-mediated blood-brain/blood-tumor barrier disruption improves outcomes with trastuzumab in a breast cancer brain metastasis model
**pmcid**: [3502612](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502612)


**doi**: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.09.007


**abstract**: Trastuzumab has shown positive results in many patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, but it is less effective for controlling metastases in the CNS, which remains a site of relapse. The poor prognosis for patients with brain metastases is thought to be largely due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that prevents delivery of most drugs to the CNS and to the heterogeneous and limited permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Focused ultrasound (FUS) bursts combined with circulating microbubbles can temporarily permeabilize both the BBB and the BTB. This technique has been investigated as a potential noninvasive method for targeted drug delivery in the brain. Here, we investigated whether BBB/BTB permeabilization in the tumor and surrounding brain tissue induced by FUS and microbubbles can slow tumor growth and improve survival in a breast cancer brain metastases model. HER2/neu-positive human breast cancer cells (BT474) were inoculated in the brains of 41 nude (nu/nu) rats. Animals in the treatment group received six weekly treatments of BTB/BBB permeabilization under MRI guidance combined with IV administration of trastuzumab (2 mg/kg). Tumor growth and survival rates were monitored via MRI for seven weeks after sonication. Starting at week seven and continuing through the end of the study, the mean tumor volume of the FUS+trastuzumab group was significantly (P<0.05) less than those of the three control groups (no treatment, FUS alone, trastuzumab alone). Furthermore, in four out of 10 rats treated with FUS+trastuzumab, the tumor appeared to be completely resolved in MRI, an outcome which was not observed in any of the 31 rats in three control groups. Trastuzumab improved median survival by 13% compared to the no treatment group, a difference which was significant (P=0.044). Treatment with FUS+trastuzumab produced the most significant benefit compared to the no-treatment controls (P=0.0084). More than half (6/10) animals survived at the study endpoint, leading to a median survival time greater than 83 days (at least 32% longer than the untreated control group). Overall, this work suggests that BBB/BTB permeabilization induced by FUS and microbubbles can improve outcomes in breast cancer brain metastases.

(a) Tumor volume vs. time; (b) Measurements normalized to the volume measured at week 1; (c) Individual measurements for all tumors at week 7 (the last week where all animals survived). The mean tumor growth with FUS+trastuzumab was substantially reduced compared to the control groups. Tumor volume was significantly less (P<0.05) than each of the three control groups at week 7. This improvement was largely driven by four animals where the tumor appeared in MRI to be completely resolved; tumor growth for the six “non-responders” was similar to the trastuzumab-only group. At the study endpoint (week 13), only the four “responders” survived. The tumor volume at week 1 was approximately 2 mm3 (mean ± standard error shown).


### Anti-HER3 Domain 1 and 3 Antibodies Reduce Tumor Growth by Hindering HER2/HER3 Dimerization and AKT-Induced MDM2, XIAP, and FoxO1 Phosphorylation12
**pmcid**: [3593156](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3593156)


**doi**: 


**abstract**: Blockade of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) and of the downstream phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is a prerequisite for overcoming drug resistance and to develop novel treatments for cancers that are not eligible for the currently approved targeted therapies. To this end, we generated specific antibodies (Abs) against domain 1 (D1) and domain 3 (D3) of HER3 that recognize epitopes that do not overlap with the neuregulin-binding site. The fully human H4B-121 Ab and the mouse monoclonal Abs 16D3-C1 and 9F7-F11 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice xenografted with epidermoid, pancreatic, or triple-negative breast cancer cells. The combination of one anti-HER3 Ab and trastuzumab improved tumor growth inhibition in mice xenografted with HER2low cancer cell lines, for which trastuzumab alone shows no or moderate efficiency. Ab-induced disruption of tumor growth was associated with G1 cell cycle arrest, proliferation inhibition, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Anti-HER3 Abs blocked HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and HER3 phosphorylation at the cell membrane, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of the downstream AKT targets murine double minute 2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and forkhead box O1. This study demonstrates that anti-HER3 D1 and D3 Abs could represent a new option for immunotherapy of pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancers.

### A single proteolytic cleavage within the lower hinge of trastuzumab reduces immune effector function and in vivo efficacy
**pmcid**: [3680949](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680949)


**doi**: 10.1186/bcr3240


**abstract**: IntroductionRecent studies reported that human IgG antibodies are susceptible to specific proteolytic cleavage in their lower hinge region, and the hinge cleavage results in a loss of Fc-mediated effector functions. Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers, and its mechanisms of action consist of inhibition of HER2 signaling and Fc-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The objective of this study is to investigate the potential effect of proteinase hinge cleavage on the efficacy of trastuzumab using both a breast cancer cell culture method and an in vivo mouse xenograft tumor model.MethodsTrastuzumab antibody was incubated with a panel of human matrix metalloproteinases, and proteolytic cleavage in the lower hinge region was detected using both western blotting and mass spectrometry. Single hinge cleaved trastuzumab (scIgG-T) was purified and evaluated for its ability to mediate ADCC and inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro as well as anti-tumor efficacy in the mouse xenograft tumor model. Infiltrated immune cells were detected in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry.ResultsscIgG-T retains HER2 antigen binding activity and inhibits HER2-mediated downstream signaling and cell proliferation in vitro when compared with the intact trastuzumab. However, scIgG-T lost Fc-mediated ADCC activity in vitro, and had significantly reduced anti-tumor efficacy in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Immunohistochemistry showed reduced immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues treated with scIgG-T when compared with those treated with the intact trastuzumab, which is consistent with the decreased ADCC mediated by scIgG-T in vitro.ConclusionTrastuzumab can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases within the lower hinge. scIgG-T exhibited a significantly reduced anti-tumor efficacy in vivo due to the weakened immune effector function such as ADCC. The results suggest that the lower hinge cleavage of trastuzumab can occur in the tumor microenvironment where matrix metalloproteinases often have high levels of expression and scIgG-T might compromise its anti-tumor efficacy in the clinic. However, further studies are needed to validate these hypotheses in the clinical setting.

### Autophagy-related gene 12 (ATG12) is a novel determinant of primary resistance to
HER2-targeted therapies: Utility of transcriptome analysis of the autophagy interactome to guide
breast cancer treatment
**pmcid**: [3681498](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681498)


**doi**: 


**abstract**: The autophagic process, which can facilitate breast cancer resistance to endocrine, cytotoxic,
and molecularly targeted agents, is mainly regulated at the post-translational level. Although
recent studies have suggested a possible transcriptome regulation of the autophagic genes, little is
known about either the analysis tools that can be applied or the functional importance of putative
candidate genes emerging from autophagy-dedicated transcriptome studies. In this context, we
evaluated whether the constitutive activation of the autophagy machinery, as revealed by a
transcriptome analysis using an autophagy-focused polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, might allow
for the identification of novel autophagy-specific biomarkers for intrinsic (primary) resistance to
HER2-targeted therapies. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based profiling of 84 genes involved
in autophagy revealed that, when compared to trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cells, the positive
regulator of autophagic vesicle formation ATG12 (autophagy-related gene 12) was the
most differentially up-regulated gene in JIMT1 cells, a model of intrinsic cross-resistance to
trastuzumab and other HER1/2-targeting drugs. An analysis of the transcriptional status of
ATG12 in > 50 breast cancer cell lines suggested that the
ATG12 transcript is commonly upregulated in trastuzumab-unresponsive
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. A lentiviral-delivered small hairpin RNA stable knockdown
of the ATG12 gene fully suppressed the refractoriness of JIMT1 cells to
trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib in vitro. ATG12 silencing
significantly reduced JIMT1 tumor growth induced by subcutaneous injection in nude mice. Remarkably,
the outgrowth of trastuzumab-unresponsive tumors was prevented completely when trastuzumab treatment
was administered in an ATG12-silenced genetic background. We demonstrate for the
first time the usefulness of low-density, autophagy-dedicated qRT-PCR-based platforms for monitoring
primary resistance to HER2-targeted therapies by transcriptionally screening the autophagy
interactome. The degree of predictive accuracy warrants further investigation in the clinical
situation.

### The anti-malarial chloroquine overcomes Primary resistance and restores sensitivity to Trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer
**pmcid**: [3749547](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749547)


**doi**: 10.1038/srep02469


**abstract**: Autophagy may control the de novo refractoriness of HER2 gene-amplified breast carcinomas to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). Tumor cells originally obtained from a patient who rapidly progressed on trastuzumab ab initio display increased cellular levels of the LC3-II protein—a finding that correlates with increased numbers of autophagosomes—and decreased levels of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1, a protein selectively degraded by autophagy. Trastuzumab-refractory cells are in a state of “autophagy addiction” because genetic ablation of autophagy-specific genes (ATG8, ATG5, ATG12) notably reduces intrinsic refractoriness to trastuzumab. When the anti-malarial lysosomotropic drug chloroquine impedes autophagic resolution of the accumulation of autophagolysosomes formed in the presence of trastuzumab, cells commit to die by apoptosis. Accordingly, combination treatment with trastuzumab and chloroquine radically suppresses tumor growth by > 90% in a tumor xenograft completely refractory to trastuzumab. Adding chloroquine to trastuzumab-based regimens may therefore improve outcomes among women with autophagy-addicted HER2-positive breast cancer.


![pmcid: 3749547](`r img_links[41]`)


**Figure 5** - Left. Shown are the mean tumor volumes (±SD) in JIMT-1 xenograft-bearing nude mice following i.p. injection with trastuzumab (5 mg/kg/week) and/or chloroquine (20 ng/kg/daily) for nine weeks. Note that tumor volumes in the trastuzumab + chloroquine group were drastically reduced in a synergistic manner compared to the untreated control group and with the single agent treatments. Changes in Bax:Bcl-2 ratios in JIMT-1 xenografts treated with trastuzumab in the absence or presence of chloroquine are also shown. The results are presented as the means (columns) and 95% confidence intervals (bars) of two independent western blotting experiments following densitometric analyses of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins (calculations were based on the arbitrary values of the bands to show the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in each tumor). Statistically significant difference (one-factor ANOVA analysis) between experimental condition groups and control groups are shown. Right. HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer cells with inherent (primary) resistance to trastuzumab are addicted to autophagy as the need for complementary bioenergetic resources in response to HER1/2-targeting drugs, which significantly affect cancer cells' addiction to certain fuel sources and metabolic pathways (“metabolic reprogramming”), is satisfied by the autophagy's ability to promote large-scale recycling of cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles including mitochondria to regenerate energy and building blocks. In addition, protective autophagy in trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer cells appears to involve a rapid targeting of HER2 protein aggregates for degradation in the autophagolysosome. In this scenario, the concurrent combination of trastuzumab with pharmacologically (i.e., chloroquine)-induced autophagy dysfunction, with blockade of autophagosome and lysosome function, and accumulation of autophagosomes and autophagy substrates, can lead to an aberrant accumulation of unmetabolized substrate with deleterious consequences (i.e., apoptotic cell death) in autophagy-addicted, trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer cells.


### Single-Antibody, Targeted Nanoparticle Delivery of Camptothecin
**pmcid**: [3795804](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3795804)


**doi**: 10.1021/mp300702x


**abstract**: We have developed a new method for assembling targeted nanoparticles that utilizes the complexation between targeting agents that contain boronic acids and polymer-drug conjugates that possess diols. Here, we report the first in vivo, antitumor results of a nanoparticle formed via this new assembly methodology. A nanoparticle consisting of a mucic acid polymer conjugate of camptothecin (CPT), MAP-CPT; and containing on average one Herceptin antibody is investigated in nude mice bearing HER2 overexpressing BT-474 human breast cancer tumors. Nontargeted MAP-CPT and antibody-containing MAP-CPT nanoparticles of ca. 30–40 nm diameter and slightly negative zeta potential show prolonged in vivo circulation and similar biodistributions after intravenous tail vein injections in mice. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the nontargeted and Herceptin-containing MAP-CPT nanoparticles are found to be 10 and 8 mg CPT/kg, respectively, in mice. Mice bearing BT-474 human breast tumors treated with nontargeted MAP-CPT nanoparticles at 8 mg CPT/kg show significant tumor growth inhibition (mean tumor volume of 63 mm3) when compared to Irinotecan at 80 mg/kg (mean tumor volume of 575 mm3) and CPT at 8 mg/kg (mean tumor volume of 808 mm3) at the end of the study. Herceptin antibody treatment at 5.9 mg/kg results in complete tumor regressions in 5 out of 8 mice, with a mean tumor volume of 60 mm3 at the end of the study. Mice treated with MAP-CPT nanoparticles at 1 mg CPT/kg do not show tumor inhibition. However, all mice receiving administrations of MAP-CPT nanoparticles (1 mg CPT/kg) that contain on average a single Herceptin molecule per nanoparticle (5.9 mg Herceptin equivalent/kg) show complete tumor regression by the end of the study. These results demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of nanoparticles carrying anticancer drugs can be enhanced by incorporating on average a single antibody.

### Optical metabolic imaging identifies glycolytic levels, sub-types and early treatment response in breast cancer
**pmcid**: [3801432](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3801432)


**doi**: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0527


**abstract**: Abnormal cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, yet there is an absence of quantitative methods to dynamically image this powerful cellular function. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is a non-invasive, high-resolution, quantitative tool for monitoring cellular metabolism. OMI probes the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of the autofluorescent metabolic co-enzymes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). We confirm that OMI correlates with cellular glycolytic levels across a panel of human breast cell lines, using standard assays of cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion (p<0.05, r=0.89). Additionally, OMI resolves differences in the basal metabolic activity of untransformed from malignant breast cells (p<0.05), and between breast cancer sub-types (p<0.05), defined by estrogen receptor (ER) and/or HER2 expression or absence. In vivo OMI is sensitive to metabolic changes induced by inhibition of HER2 with the antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in mice. This response was confirmed with tumor growth curves and stains for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3. OMI resolved trastuzumab-induced changes in cellular metabolism in vivo as early as 48 hours post-treatment (p<0.05), while FDG-PET did not resolve any changes with trastuzumab up to 12-days post-treatment (p>0.05). In addition, OMI resolved cellular sub-populations of differing response in vivo that are critical for investigating drug resistance mechanisms. Importantly, OMI endpoints remained unchanged with trastuzumab-treatment in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts (p>0.05). OMI has significant implications for rapid cellular-level assessment of metabolic response to molecular expression and drug action, which would greatly accelerate drug development studies.

### The anti-erbB3 antibody MM-121/SAR256212 in combination with trastuzumab exerts potent antitumor activity against trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells
**pmcid**: [3829386](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3829386)


**doi**: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-134


**abstract**: BackgroundElevated expression of erbB3 receptor has been reported to induce resistance to therapeutic agents, including trastuzumab in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Our recent studies indicate that erbB3 interacts with both erbB2 and IGF-1 receptor to form a heterotrimeric complex in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. Herein, we investigate the antitumor activity of MM-121/SAR256212, a fully human anti-erbB3 antibody (Ab), against two erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines resistant to trastuzumab.MethodsMTS-based proliferation assays were used to determine cell viability upon treatment of trastuzumab and/or MM-121/SAR256212. Cell cycle progression was examined by flow cytometric analysis. Western blot analyses were performed to determine the expression and activation of proteins. Tumor xenografts were established by inoculation of the trastuzumab-resistant BT474-HR20 cells into nude mice. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with trastuzumab and/or MM-121/SAR256212 via i.p injection to determine the Abs’ antitumor activity. Immunohistochemical analyses were carried out to study the Abs’ inhibitory effects on tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vivo.ResultsMM-121 significantly enhanced trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition in two sensitive and two resistant breast cancer cell lines. MM-121 in combination with trastuzumab resulted in a dramatic reduction of phosphorylated erbB3 (P-erbB3) and Akt (P-Akt) in the in vitro studies. MM-121 combined with trastuzumab did not induce apoptosis in the trastuzumab-resistant cell lines under our cell culture condition, rather induced cell cycle G1 arrest mainly associated with the upregulation of p27kip1. Interestingly, in the tumor xenograft model established from the trastuzumab-resistant cells, MM-121 in combination with trastuzumab as compared to either agent alone dramatically inhibited tumor growth correlated with a significant reduction of Ki67 staining and increase of cleaved caspase-3 in the tumor tissues.ConclusionsThe combination of MM-121 and trastuzumab not only inhibits erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell proliferation, but also promotes the otherwise trastuzumab-resistant cells undergoing apoptosis in an in vivo xenografts model. Thus, MM-121 exhibits potent antitumor activity when combined with trastuzumab under the studied conditions. Our data suggest that further studies regarding the suitability of MM-121 for treatment of breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress erbB2 and become resistant to trastuzumab may be warranted.

The tumor-bearing mice (n=5) received i.p. injections of PBS, trastuzumab, MM-121, or trastuzumab plus MM-121 as described in the Materials and Methods. After 6 treatments, the mice were euthanized at day 36 post injection of tumor cells, and all tumors were excised for histology and IHC analysis. A, The graphs show the tumor growth curves. Bars, SD.

The residual tumor cells obtained from combinatorial treatments retained similar expression levels of erbB2/erbB3 receptors on the cell membrane.


### Combined blockade of HER2 and VEGF exerts greater growth inhibition of HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer xenografts than individual blockadeHER2 and VEGF dual blockade in gastric cancer
**pmcid**: [3849567](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3849567)


**doi**: 10.1038/emm.2013.111


**abstract**: Gastric cancer overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) protein has a poor outcome, although a combination of chemotherapy and the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab has been approved for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in gastric cancer is correlated with recurrence and poor prognosis; however, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab has shown limited efficacy against gastric cancer in clinical trials. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor effects of trastuzumab; VEGF-Trap binding to VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF); and a combination of trastuzumab and VEGF-Trap in a gastric cancer xenograft model. Although trastuzumab and VEGF-Trap each moderately inhibited tumor growth, the combination of these agents exerted greater inhibition compared with either agent alone. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the reduction in tumor growth was associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of tumor cells and decreased tumor vascular density. The combined treatment resulted in fewer proliferating tumor cells, more apoptotic cells and reduced tumor vascular density compared with treatment with trastuzumab or VEGF-Trap alone, indicating that trastuzumab and VEGF-Trap had additive inhibitory effects on the tumor growth and angiogenesis of the gastric cancer xenografts. These data suggest that trastuzumab in combination with VEGF-Trap may represent an effective approach to treating HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer.

### Neratinib overcomes trastuzumab resistance in HER2 amplified breast cancer
**pmcid**: [3858548](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3858548)


**doi**: 


**abstract**: Trastuzumab has been shown to improve the survival outcomes of HER2 positive breast cancer patients. However, a significant proportion of HER2-positive patients are either inherently resistant or develop resistance to trastuzumab. We assessed the effects of neratinib, an irreversible panHER inhibitor, in a panel of 36 breast cancer cell lines. We further assessed its effects with or without trastuzumab in several sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells as well as a BT474 xenograft model. We confirmed that neratinib was significantly more active in HER2-amplified than HER2 non-amplified cell lines. Neratinib decreased the activation of the 4 HER receptors and inhibited downstream pathways. However, HER3 and Akt were reactivated at 24 hours, which was prevented by the combination of trastuzumab and neratinib. Neratinib also decreased pHER2 and pHER3 in acquired trastuzumab resistant cells. Neratinib in combination with trastuzumab had a greater growth inhibitory effect than either drug alone in 4 HER2 positive cell lines. Furthermore, trastuzumab in combination with neratinib was growth inhibitory in SKBR3 and BT474 cells which had acquired resistance to trastuzumab as well as in a BT474 xenograft model. Innately trastuzumab resistant cell lines showed sensitivity to neratinib, but the combination did not enhance response compared to neratinib alone. Levels of HER2 and phospho-HER2 showed a direct correlation with sensitivity to neratinib. Our data indicate that neratinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy and counteracted both innate and acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our results suggest that combined treatment with trastuzumab and neratinib is likely to be more effective than either treatment alone for both trastuzumab-sensitive breast cancer as well as HER2-positive tumors with acquired resistance to trastuzumab.

### Combating trastuzumab resistance by targeting SRC, a common node downstream of multiple resistance pathways
**pmcid**: [3877934](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877934)


**doi**: 10.1038/nm.2309


**abstract**: Trastuzumab is a successful rationally designed ERBB2-targeted therapy. However, about half of individuals with ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer do not respond to trastuzumab-based therapies, owing to various resistance mechanisms. Clinically applicable regimens for overcoming trastuzumab resistance of different mechanisms are not yet available. We show that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (SRC) is a key modulator of trastuzumab response and a common node downstream of multiple trastuzumab resistance pathways. We find that SRC is activated in both acquired and de novo trastuzumab-resistant cells and uncover a novel mechanism of SRC regulation involving dephosphorylation by PTEN. Increased SRC activation conferred considerable trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells and correlated with trastuzumab resistance in patients. Targeting SRC in combination with trastuzumab sensitized multiple lines of trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab and eliminated trastuzumab-resistant tumors in vivo, suggesting the potential clinical application of this strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.

### Epigenetic silencing of miR-375 induces trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer by targeting IGF1R
**pmcid**: [3974046](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974046)


**doi**: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-134


**abstract**: BackgroundResistance to humanized monoclonal erbB2/HER2 antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin), has become a pivotal obstacle for targeted therapy of HER2-positive breast cancers. The activation of alternative growth factor receptors, in particular, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), represents a common feature of trastuzumab-refractory cells; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.MethodsTrastuzumab-resistant breast cancer SKBr-3 cells were generated by long-term in vitro culture of SKBr-3 cells in the presence of trastuzumab. Among the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) screened by microarray analysis, candidate miRNA(s) predicted to target IGF1R was studied for its role in conferring trastuzumab resistance. The mechanism underlying decreased expression of IGF1R-targeted miRNA in refractory cells was also addressed.ResultsmiR-375, which was downregulated and predicted to target IGF1R in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells, could indeed inhibit the cellular luciferase activity in a reporter construct containing the 3′-UTR of IGF1R. Overexpression of miR-375 restored the sensitivity of cells to trastuzumab, while inhibition of miR-375 conferred trastuzumab resistance on HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Blockade of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation restored the expression of miR-375 in trastuzumab-resistant cells. A reverse correlation between the levels of miR-375 and IGF1R was validated in clinical breast cancers.ConclusionsEpigenetic silencing of miR-375 causes the upregulation of IGF1R, which at least partially underlies trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer cells. Our study has implications for miR-375 as a potential target in combination with trastuzumab for treating HER2-positive breast cancers.

**abstract**: IntroductionTrastuzumab has been widely used for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing breast cancer for more than a decade. However, reports on the involvement of HER2 downregulation in trastuzumab’s mechanism of action are inconsistent. The aim of this study is to investigate if the dependence of trastuzumab-mediated cancer cell HER2 downregulation on immune effector cells represents a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab.MethodsHER2 expression was evaluated by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cell lysates from co-cultures of multiple cancer cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence or absence of trastuzumab. The engagement of immune cells by trastuzumab through Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) was tested using three trastuzumab variants with compromised or no Fc (fragment crystallizable) functions and FcγRs blocking experiments. The engagement of immune cells by trastuzumab in HER2 downregulation was also evaluated in in vivo mouse xenograft tumor models.ResultsHER2 downregulation of cancer cells by trastuzumab occurred only when trastuzumab was actively engaged with immune cells and cancer cells, as demonstrated consistently in co-cultures of cancer cell lines with PBMCs and in vivo mouse xenograft tumor models. We further demonstrated that HER2 downregulation in cancer cells by immune-cell-engaged trastuzumab was at the transcriptional level, not through the HER2 degradation pathway. Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in cancer cells by the increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in immune cells played an important role in downregulating HER2 in cancer cells upon engagement of immune cells by trastuzumab. Furthermore, HER2 downregulation in cancer cells induced by trastuzumab engagement of immune cells was correlated with the antibody’s antitumor efficacy in vivo.ConclusionsThis study reveals that engagement of immune effector cells by trastuzumab induces HER2 downregulation in HER2-expressing cancer cells, which represents a new function of immune cells in trastuzumab-mediated antitumor efficacy and serves as a novel mechanism of action for trastuzumab. Our results imply that HER2 downregulation in cancer cells treated by trastuzumab may predict active engagement of immune effector cells in tumor microenvironment.

**abstract**: HER2-amplified (HER2 + ) breast cancers are treated with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Although trastuzumab reduces production of the angiogenic factor VEGF in HER2 + tumors, the acute and sustained effects of trastuzumab on the tumor vasculature are not understood fully, particularly in trastuzumab-resistant tumors. We used mouse models of trastuzumab sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2 + breast cancers to measure dynamic changes in tumor microvessel density and hemoglobin oxygenation (sO2) in vivo using quantitative hyperspectral imaging at 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after antibody treatment. Further analysis quantified the distribution of microvessels into low and high oxygenation groups, and monitored changes in these distributions with trastuzumab treatment. Gold standard immunohistochemistry was performed to validate complementary markers of tumor cell and vascular response to treatment. Trastuzumab treatment in both responsive and resistant tumors resulted in decreased sO2 5 days after initial treatment when compared to IgG-treated controls (p<0.05). Importantly, responsive tumors showed significantly higher vessel density and significantly lower sO2 than all other groups at 5 days post-treatment (p<0.05). Distribution analysis of vessel sO2 showed a significant (p<0.05) shift of highly oxygenated vessels towards lower oxygenation over the time-course in both trastuzumab-treated responsive and resistant tumors. This study suggests that longitudinal hyperspectral imaging of microvessel sO2 and density could distinguish trastuzumab-responsive from trastuzumab-resistant tumors, a finding that could be exploited in the post-neoadjuvant setting to guide post-surgical treatment decisions.

**abstract**: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling are drivers of tumorigenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Previous studies have demonstrated that combinatorial treatment of PDAC xenografts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase–extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor trametinib and the dual EGFR/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitor lapatinib provided more effective inhibition than either treatment alone. In this study, we have used the therapeutic antibodies, panitumumab (specific for EGFR) and trastuzumab (specific for HER2), to probe the role of EGFR and HER2 signaling in the proliferation of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. We show that dual anti-EGFR and anti-HER2 therapy significantly augmented the growth inhibitory effects of the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib in three different PDX tumors. While significant growth inhibition was observed in both KRAS mutant xenograft groups receiving trametinib and dual antibody therapy (tumors 366 and 608), tumor regression was observed in the KRAS wild-type xenografts (tumor 738) treated in the same manner. Dual antibody therapy in conjunction with trametinib was equally or more effective at inhibiting tumor growth and with lower apparent toxicity than trametinib plus lapatinib. Together, these studies provide further support for a role for EGFR and HER2 in pancreatic cancer proliferation and underscore the importance of therapeutic intervention in both the KRAS–rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase (RAF)–MEK–ERK and EGFR-HER2 pathways to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy in patients.

**Figure 3** - In vivo response of PDX tumors to trametinib and antibody treatment. (A, C, and E) In vivo response of three different established PDAC tumors (100-500 mm3 before starting therapy) to treatment with vehicle control (black bar), trametinib (Tra), panitumumab (P), or trametinib plus panitumumab (Tra + P) (treated mice, hatched bars). The number of mice in each treatment group is indicated in parentheses. An MRI was obtained just before the start of treatment to establish an index tumor volume for each mouse. Subsequent interval MRI studies were used to assess the change in tumor volume while on treatment (see Figure W2). To calculate the relative change in tumor volume (fold change) for each tumor, the interval tumor volumes were divided by the index tumor volume and linear regression was used to model a line of best fit for the tumor fold change data plotted relative to time. The slope of that line of best fit demonstrates the tumor growth rate for each treatment group expressed as the fold change per week on treatment. Mean fold change per week plus the standard error of the mean are displayed for each treatment group as bar graphs. Significance is denoted as *P < .05. Following the initial treatment period, a group of mice treated with trametinib was maintained on trametinib. Mice in the panitumumab (P) group were switched to panitumumab plus trastuzumab (P + T) and mice in the trametinib plus panitumumab (Tra + P) group were switched to combined treatment with panitumumab, trastuzumab, and trametinib (Tra + P + T) for an additional 2 to 4 weeks (open bars, Figure W2). (B, D, and F) Representative MRI images of control and triple therapy–treated (Tra + P + T) tumors obtained just before the onset of treatment (Start Rx) and at the conclusion of treatment just before sacrifice (End Rx). The tumors are outlined and these images depict the axial slice with the largest cross-sectional area in each tumor.

**Figure 4** - Comparison of in vivo response of PDX tumors to trametinib plus lapatinib versus trametinib plus antibody treatment. (A and B) In vivo response of two different PDAC tumors to treatment with vehicle control, trametinib plus lapatinib (Tra + L), trametinib plus pertuzumab (Tra + PZ), or trametinib plus panitumumab plus trastuzumab (Tra + P + T). Tumors were allowed to grow to a starting volume of 100 to 500 mm3 before the onset of treatment. Mice were treated with vehicle control or drug therapy for 4 weeks (the number of mice in each treatment group is indicated in parentheses). Initial tumor volume was assessed by MRI before the start of dosing and subsequent weekly MRI assessments were carried out to calculate the change in relative tumor volume (see also Figure W3). The mean relative tumor volume ± the standard error of the mean over time is plotted in line graph form for each treatment group. Linear regression was used to model a line of best fit for the tumor fold change data plotted relative to time. The slope of that line of best fit that served as an estimate of the tumor growth rate for each treatment group expressed as fold change per week on treatment was determined as described in the Materials and Methods section. The mean fold change per week ± the standard error of the mean are displayed for each treatment group as bar graphs. Significance is denoted as *P < .05.
